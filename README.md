## 🚀 How It Works

**Step 1: Choose Your Target**  
Select the fish species you're after - whether it's Redfish in the shallows, Largemouth Bass in the lake, or Yellowfin Tuna offshore. Each species has unique preferences that TideRunner knows inside and out.

**Step 2: Pick Your Spot**  
Tap anywhere on the interactive map - your favorite fishing hole, a new location you want to try, or follow the coastline looking for optimal conditions.

**Step 3: Get Your Score**  
TideRunner instantly analyzes 15+ environmental factors and calculates a Fishing Suitability Score specific to your chosen species. See exactly what's working in your favor (and what's not).

**Step 4: Time It Right**  
Check tide times, solunar feeding periods, and moon phase data. TideRunner tells you not just *where* to fish, but *when* the bite will be hottest.

**Step 5: Catch More Fish!**  
Armed with professional-grade intelligence, you'll spend less time guessing and more time reeling them in. 🎣

## 📊 What TideRunner Analyzes

Every Fishing Suitability Score considers:

**🌡️ Water Temperature** - Is it in the optimal range for your species?  
**🌊 Wave & Current Conditions** - Too rough, too calm, or just right?  
**💨 Wind Speed & Direction** - Affecting bait movement and boat control  
**🌙 Moon Phase** - Full moon? New moon? It matters!  
**🌊 Tide Timing** - Rising, falling, slack, or peak - when do they feed?  
**⏰ Solunar Periods** - The secret weapon of tournament anglers  
**🌅 Sun Position** - Dawn and dusk bite times calculated  
**📍 Location-Specific Data** - Every spot is different
